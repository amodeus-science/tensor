/** Gaussian elimination is the most important algorithm of all time.
 * 
 * <p>Quote from Wikipedia:
 * The method of Gaussian elimination appears in the Chinese mathematical text Chapter
 * Eight Rectangular Arrays of The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. Its use is
 * illustrated in eighteen problems, with two to five equations. The first reference to
 * the book by this title is dated to 179 CE, but parts of it were written as early as
 * approximately 150 BCE. It was commented on by Liu Hui in the 3rd century.
 * The method in Europe stems from the notes of Isaac Newton. In 1670, he wrote that all
 * the algebra books known to him lacked a lesson for solving simultaneous equations,
 * which Newton then supplied. Cambridge University eventually published the notes as
 * Arithmetica Universalis in 1707 long after Newton left academic life. The notes were
 * widely imitated, which made (what is now called) Gaussian elimination a standard lesson
 * in algebra textbooks by the end of the 18th century. Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1810
 * devised a notation for symmetric elimination that was adopted in the 19th century by
 * professional hand computers to solve the normal equations of least-squares problems.
 * The algorithm that is taught in high school was named for Gauss only in the 1950s as
 * a result of confusion over the history of the subject. */
